      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m a student growing in faith. I started my walk with God when I got i into the univeristy. The journey hasn't been a an easy one, but God is faithful!</p>
      <p>God has helped me in this journey of faith. I met my rooommate at the post utme centre. He was the one God sent into my life. I got born again in 100 level. It was something I prayed about.</p>
